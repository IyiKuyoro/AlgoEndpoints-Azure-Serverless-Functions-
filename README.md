## Algo Functions

Everyday, I try to solve at least one algorithm challenge. These challenges are provided by [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/). Over time, they have helped me hone my algo skills and I felt I should share the usage of those I find interesting. I did not want to create a standard web app or add it to my Portfolio's REST API, so I decided to use Azure's very interesting tool- Azure Serverless Functions.

Most of the endpoints will be post requests expecting some data of some sort in relation to the challenge.
